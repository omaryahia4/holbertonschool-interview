# Linked list cycle
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
-   Whiteboard first
-   This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solutionâ€™s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
-   Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
